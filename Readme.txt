Standard Monitor by Nigel Thomas V2

Description

This is an addin that allows you to check that any forms you develop
meets the standards that are laid down for you to follow. An example
might be that command buttons have a particular height and
width etc. as specified in a company standards document.

Instructions

Compile the code and register the DLL. Open VB and add a command button 
on the form. Look to the right on the toolbar, you will find a new
icon. Click the icon and the setup tab is shown.

In the controls combo on the lower left all the controls on the active 
VB form are listed. Next to this is the properties combo. This simply
shows the properties for the current control. Select height in the 
properties combo. Next to this combo is the value textbox. Type in 
the value for the control/property combination here, i.e. 375 for 
command button height.

Click Add to add the standard to the listview, click Update to make  
this permanent in the registry. Next go to the Report tab. Click
the Report button and if the height for the command button doesn't
meet your standard it will be listed.
